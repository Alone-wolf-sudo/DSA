What is Hashing?
Hashing is the process of mapping data of arbitrary size (like strings or objects) to a fixed-size value (called a hash code or hash value) using a hash function. The idea is to convert a piece of data into a small, fixed-size representation (typically an integer or a string) that uniquely identifies the original data.

Why use hashing?

Efficiency: Hashing provides a way to quickly look up data. Instead of searching through a list or a collection, you can directly access the hashed value.

Storage: Hashing is used for storage efficiency in structures like hash tables or dictionaries, which enable fast retrieval of data.
